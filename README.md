# Deep Learning Predictive Model

---

To the business team at Alphabet Soup, I present a binary classification model using a deep neural network along with two alternative models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. These models will predict whether applicants will be succesfull if we were to provide support.

Using the CSV file provided, I have performed the following:

1. Pre-processed the data for a neural network model.
2. Used the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
3. Optimized the model.
